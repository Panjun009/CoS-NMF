Description: The code tackles the Co-separable nonnegative matrix factorization (Cos-NMF) problem: Given a nonnegative matrix M and integers (r1,r2), find index sets K1 and K2 with r1 and r2 indices respectivity, and nonnegative matrices P1 and P2, such that || M - P_1M(K1, K1)P_2 ||_F is minimized.
